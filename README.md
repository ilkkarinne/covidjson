# CovidJSON (Infection testing JSON)
**NOTE: this is a draft version**

A GeoJSON data model for viral infection testing data based on Observations & measurements OGC/ISO Standard ([O&M, ISO 19156](https://www.iso.org/standard/32574.html)) concepts. Created specifically for recording and exchanging data on SARS-CoV-2 infection tests, but likely applicable also to describing test data for detecting other infectious diseases too.

See https://covidjson.org/ for more details.

Initially developed by Ilkka Rinne / Spatineo as part of the activities of the [CoronaGISFinland](https://geoforum.fi/paikkatiedon-koronavirus-asiantuntijat/), the Finnish task expert force for leveraging GIS for helping the Finnish governmental organisations, communities and companies in mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemia in 2020.

Mock data examples are available under [examples](./examples/) and up-to-date data samples using real COVID-19 data at [CovidJSON Data](https://data.covidjson.org/).

**Important**: Data contained in the examples directory is fictious. For up-to-date official information on the COVID-19 situation in Finland, see https://thl.fi/en/web/infectious-diseases/what-s-new/coronavirus-covid-19-latest-updates
